Radioberry 

Equiped with an ethernet module, LAN8720.

i.s.o. implementing the protocol-1 or protocol-2 in the FPGA i am using the ethernet connection i.s.o. the spi port of the raspberry pi.

The c-part of the firmware running at the rpi will control the connection with the radioberry and implements the P-1 or P-2 protocol.

Iam still thinking of making a change to the PCB by adding the LAN controller or making a additional pluginboard.

The radioberry started as a 'simple' standalone radio, but of course by adding this cheap ethernet module the 
radio will support more rx slices with higher sampling rates.

I still need to think about the internal protocol between rpi or radioberry.


As always it is all beta software.... no warranty!

Have fun!
